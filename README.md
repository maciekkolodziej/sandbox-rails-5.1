# Wath's new
* `rails new --webpack=react`
* `yarn` as package manager
* compile js with webpack (gem `webpacker`) `./bin/webpack-dev-server`

# To remember
* use yarn as a js package manager (it uses npm registry <https://www.sitepoint.com/yarn-vs-npm>)
* place react components `app/javascript/component_name` and `require('component_name'')` in js pack

# TO-DO
* play with `foreman` <https://ddollar.github.io/foreman/>
